        <h4 class="title-about-inspiration">Harmony of Taste and Form</h4>
        <br>
        <p class="description-of-inspiration">
          The restaurant is a space where haute cuisine meets architectural aesthetics.
          Each dish is the result of meticulous attention to detail, a careful selection of premium ingredients,
          and inspiration drawn from modernism and brutalism.
          The interior embodies a blend of natural textures, clean geometric lines, and refined simplicity.
          The restaurant’s owner believes that food is not just about taste,
          but a form of art that deserves to be served in an elegant and thoughtful environment.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="description-of-inspiration">
          As the designer of the kitchen management interface,
          I was likewise inspired by brutalism, minimalism, and modernism.
          These styles shaped my vision of a clear, structured, and highly functional platform.
          The minimalist approach allowed me to strip away the unnecessary and focus entirely on efficiency,
          while brutalist aesthetics brought a sense of boldness, control, and presence.
          These principles became the foundation of my design — a system built to support the kitchen in working harmoniously,
          cleanly, and with creative precision.

          This project is a restaurant kitchen management interface designed with a focus on clarity and usability.
          Inspired by modernism, brutalism, and minimalism, it allows chefs and kitchen staff to easily manage dishes,
          assign cooks, and update menu items in a structured and elegant environment.
          The platform ensures intuitive control over the kitchen workflow,
          keeping the design clean, functional, and aesthetically aligned with the restaurant’s concept.
