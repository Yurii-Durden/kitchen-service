        <p class="description-of-inspiration">
          The restaurant is a space where haute cuisine meets architectural aesthetics.
          Each dish is the result of meticulous attention to detail, a careful selection of premium ingredients,
          and inspiration drawn from modernism and brutalism. The restaurant’s owner believes that food is not just about taste,
          but a form of art that deserves to be served in an elegant and thoughtful environment.
        </p>

        <p class="description-of-inspiration description-of-inspiration_of_me">
          As the designer of the kitchen management interface,
          I was likewise inspired by the design and idea of the restaurant.
          The minimalist approach allowed me to strip away the unnecessary and focus entirely on efficiency,
          while brutalist aesthetics brought a sense of boldness, control, and presence.
          These principles became the foundation of my design.

          This project is a restaurant kitchen management interface designed with a focus on clarity, efficiency, and elegance.
          It allows chefs and kitchen staff to seamlessly manage dishes, assign responsibilities,
          and update menu items within a structured and sophisticated environment.
          The platform ensures intuitive control over kitchen workflow — keeping the experience functional,
          visually coherent, and deeply aligned with the restaurant’s brutalist-modernist concept.

        Just as every restaurant has its own unique identity, kitchen management
        can be designed in various innovative and efficient ways to enhance workflow and productivity.
        Kitchen service brings your kitchen's operations to life with a streamlined,
        functional interface that reflects your restaurant's distinct style.

        <h5 class="philosophy-title">PHILOSOPHY</h5>
        <p>
          I believe a kitchen is more than just a workspace. It is a place where design and function come together with purpose.
          My approach is built on simplicity, clarity, and precision. I aim to create an environment that supports natural flow,
          where every movement feels intuitive and every element has meaning.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Everything is designed to help the team work in sync and to let creativity grow without distraction.
          It is about harmony between vision and execution, between style and purpose.
